Abstract
--------

“Search, and you will find”

Implementation of an audio search system for Peragro. An Audio Information
Retrieval(AIR) system that would provide client API(s) for audio search and
information retrieval. Search will be based on annotated text/descriptions or
tags/labels associated with an audio as well as on low and high level features.
Focus is to implement an AIR system that provides text based and content based
search. Users would be able to perform query through the provided client API(s)
and will get list of relevant audios in return.
