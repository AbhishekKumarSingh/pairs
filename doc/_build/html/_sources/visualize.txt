Audio Data Visualization/Analytics Using Kibana
================================================

Introduction
-------------

Kibana is an open source analytics and visualization platform designed to work
with Elasticsearch. Kibana can be used to search, view, and interact with data
stored in Elasticsearch indices. We can easily perform advanced data analysis
and visualize our data in a variety of charts, tables, and maps format.

Kibana makes it easy to understand large volumes of data. Its simple,
browser-based interface enables us to quickly create and share dynamic
dashboards that display changes to Elasticsearch queries in real time.

We can install Kibana and start exploring our Elasticsearch indices in
minutes without any code, or any additional infrastructure required.

Getting Kibana up
-------------------

Requirements:
*************

* Elasticsearch 2.3 or later
* A modern web browser
*  Information about our Elasticsearch installation:

   * URL of the Elasticsearch instance we want to connect to.
   * Which Elasticsearch indices we want to search.

Install and start Kibana
**************************

Installing kibana with apt-get

1. Download and install the Public Signing Key:


   .. code-block:: bash

        wget -qO - https://packages.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -


2. Add the repository definition to your /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kibana.list
   file:


   .. code-block:: bash

        echo "deb http://packages.elastic.co/kibana/4.5/debian stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list


3. Run apt-get update and the repository is ready for use. Install Kibana with
   the following command:


   .. code-block:: bash

        sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install kibana


4.  Configure Kibana to automatically start during bootup. If your distribution
    is using the System V version of init, run the following command:


    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo update-rc.d kibana defaults 95 10


5. start kibana


   .. code-block:: bash

        sudo service kibana start



That’s it! Kibana is now running on port 5601. You can access the kibana UI by
pointing your browser to:

.. code-block:: bash

        http://localhost:5601



Configuring an index pattern
-----------------------------

remove check from `Index contains time-based events` and put Index name or
pattern (as used in elasticsearch) and start.

Now, we are in position to visualize and analyze data stored at that index.

Something which we can do is:

* Search and browse your data interactively from the Discover page.
* Chart and map your data from the Visualize page.
* Create and view custom dashboards from the Dashboard page.
